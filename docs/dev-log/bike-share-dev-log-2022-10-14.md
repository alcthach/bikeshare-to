# Bike Share Toronto - Data Cleaning Methodology 

2022-10-14

---

I've created this document to highlight the steps taken to clean the Bike Share Data

At this point, several decisions where made to get the data to where it is currently. However, the issue is I'm kind of blocked now because I don't recall what I've done to the data. And I can't guarantee any kind of quality either. 

So I'm going to revisit and document some of the decisions I made with data so far. This may also help with communicating to others that might work with the data to understand what's already been done and what is still outstanding. Saving them some time and operations that have already been completed.

And for my mental health and well-being I think this will move me forward in the project. I just felt a bit overwhelmed and frustrated getting blocked again, which in reality shouldn't bother me too much. But I haven't been feeling the greatest these days. Anyways, I'll go ahead and highlight what's been accompolished so far, some considerations, and some assumptions as well.
