I think there might be an issue with my permissions. I can't seem to allow access for dbeaver to the database. This is like the same issue with pgfutter.

There are some massive issues with connecting to the database using dbeaver and possibly pgfutter. I appreciate that the tool is supposed to make my life easier. However, it's like that this point that there are some issues with the database since upgrading to Fedora 37.  I think I'll just back up all of the files that I have so far. Push changes to the repo for all my text files.

Then re-install my system fresh then go on to see if I can. Re-initiallize everything. I think there are some manual solutions that I could use instead of the tooling...

The issue is that when something breaks I'm not able to troubleshoot it. This is the issue with abstraction, it helps when it works. But leaves you in the dark when it's not.
