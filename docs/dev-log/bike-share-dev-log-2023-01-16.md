A lot of the cleaning has been completed. However, I'm now faced with having to impute the missing station IDs. The tricky part is this data lives in JSON format. Which luckily I'm familiar with from working with the FPL project. 

I'll need to do a bit of profiling of this data. I could make my own reference table to save on time instead. But I think I'll see if I could pull the data from the endpoint.
