I think I'm going to brute force check to see if some of the questionable `start_station_name` null value rows have a semantic match to the `bst_stations` table.

I think this work is a bit more nuanced. And might take me some time to find a pattern, or patterns to employ. However, in order to re-deploy this project I'll have to ensure the transformations all live in script somewhere.
