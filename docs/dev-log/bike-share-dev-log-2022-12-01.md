I might have to do some data profiling on the slices of data I've loaded

### Data Profiling Notes

`raw_2017_q1_q2_trips`

- Don't expect the the columns to have null values, only blank character values
- Doesn't seem like I have null values, however, the datetime columns will need to be converted to time stamp
- I'll need to go through some dev log entries to see what I did. Perhaps even review some of the code that I've written to clean the data

Alright, it looks like I was able to manage the dbeaver connect to my database. It seems that with the recent dbbeaver update there might have been some changes in the default connection settings to a database.

This is something that I'll have to look into. I don't remember changing settings in `/var/lib/pgsql/pg_hba.conf` However, this is something that'll I'll have to keep in mind moving forward in case I'm doing a re-install of dbeaver.

I feel a bit crappy that I'm not able to progress too much this morning. But like Darwin had mentioned. It's pretty important to ensure that I set up my environment properly. Without it I wouldn't be able to do too much because I actually need to touch the data to touch the data to push the project forward. If not, I'm stuck trying to conceptualize the data. 

Plus the way that I've loaded the data this time around I'm not sure if I can use the same scripts. I think I'm working with different slices of the data. 

That's something that I'll have to take a look at after my break. 

After a bit of a break. I'm going to take a moment to catch myself up on the project. I've found that I might be a bit ahead of myself right now. It would probably be smoother for me to internalize where I am right now with the project. Right now it's okay because I've just been setting up my environment for now. However, moving forward I would stand to benefit from reviewing my dev log and also reviewing the code that I've written so far. 

Luckily I don't need internet to do this. I've done 2 units of deep-focused work right now. I  have about 3-4 units left for today. I think my focus/attention battery is pretty good right now.
