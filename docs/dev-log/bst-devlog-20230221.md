Seems like I might be in the next cycle of profiling the data. Might help for me to get reacquainted with the data and see if there's anything else I'd like to do before surfacing the data to the business user.

I don't think I persisted the changes for the missing start and end station names.

I'll also need to persist the changes in the collation of `trip_id` as well.

Alright coming back from break, I'm going to explore the remaining null values.

Alright, I'll try to see if can sort out this issue before I wrap up for the day.
