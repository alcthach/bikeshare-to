# Goal for Today:
- Load the rest of the data to the destination table
- Find some material on data profiling, cleaning, etc. Re: Framework to help prepare and model the data

All the rows were loaded into the destination table `'trips'`
- At minimum they follow the constraints of the data definition language (DDL)

The next step is to find a framework to help me profiling, clean and model the data
