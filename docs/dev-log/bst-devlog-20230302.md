From what I remember, I think I was trying to see if I could create a `CASE WHEN` statements to change the start and end stations name to match up with the ones in `bst_stations` this way, I can join the tables and impute corresponding station IDs.

Going to hop into Data Grip and take a look at what I have so far!
