I'm looking to pivot off this project. However, it seems like this might not be the best move. Based on the data, we might be looking at a large subset of the population that depends on the service. So I'm thinking that it would make sense to explore the data. And they see if it's worth following through with the project. I think it's because in principle, I value good design in my environment. And this is something that will make the world a better place. Both in terms of planetary health, and in terms of population health. And perhaps even productivity. 

Even if the program operates at a loss. Which areas would we see growth?

I forget that this was an opportunity to also demonstrate my technical skills as well. I'm prioritizing shipping something out as a PoC of my skills. This was the whole reason that I took on this project. Less overhead. Whlie I work on the FPL project. 

Makes it easier for me to have a project in my portfolio. Which I desperately need right now.
