Today is going to be a bit of a learning day for me. I understand how to load a csv to the database. 

However I need to figure out how I'm going to make the data to the destination table. 

I'll problem use SQL Alchemy due to its robustness.

Did a little bit of the sqlalchemy tutorial, learned that it's an ORM, so it's use case is a bit different than psycopg2 from what I understand

I'm going to see if I could figure out this business with SELECT INTO statement first

Going to implement and see how it does
