# Bike Share Toronto End-To-End Analytics Project

### TODO: 
- Draft README.me
- Profile, clean and load data to 'trips' destination table
- Work on data documentation during shallow work periods
- Re-factor SQL code sometime later after building data models and analytics layers
- Consolidate `user_type` values
